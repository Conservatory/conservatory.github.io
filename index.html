<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 167%; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" >Sometimes open source code drops off the Net, never to be seen in public again.</p>

<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 167%; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;" >The Conservatory is here to fix that.</p>

<p>Welcome to the Conservatory:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 7%;" ><a href="https://github.com/Conservatory">github.com/Conservatory</a></p>

<p>The Conservatory is an archive for <a href="http://opensource.org/definition">open source</a> and <a href="http://opensource.org/faq#public-domain" >public domain</a> code that doesn't have any other clear canonical version-controlled home on the public Internet.  It's a place to preserve code whose authors</p>

<ol>
<li>Haven't put it under public version control, or...</li>
<li>Have abandoned it, neglecting even to keep a copy on a public
    server, or even...</li>
<li>Have actively tried to remove it from the Net, open source license notwithstanding.</li>
<p style="font-size: 85%; font-style: italic;" >You might think that (3) never happens, but actually an <a href="https://github.com/Conservatory/openstv/blob/master/README.md">instance of it</a> was part of what motivated the creation of the Conservatory... and then it happened <a href="https://github.com/Conservatory/healthcare.gov-2013-10-01/blob/master/README.md" >again</a>.</p>
</ol>

<p>The Conservatory is strictly about preservation and ease of revival.  The presence of a codebase in the Conservatory is <em>not</em> a criticism of the code's authors or former maintainers.  No one is obligated to maintain a public repository of anything, unless they've signed a contract to do so, in which case their obligation is to the contractual counterparty not to the public at large.</p>

<p>The Conservatory is archival.  Repositories here do not take pull requests because they are not meant to be the "social master" repository of their respective projects.  If you want to work on one of the codebases, please fork it to a new repository and work on it there.  If your fork catches on, it will be the new master&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and the Conservatory's copy will become less and less important (as well as increasingly out-of-date), which is fine.</p></div>

<div id="submitting" title="submitting" ><h3>How to put code in the Conservatory.</h3>

<p>First make absolutely sure it's licensed under an open source license or is in the public domain, and make sure you've got a copy of the code yourself (don't count on it staying wherever on the Net you found it&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;if it disappeared from other places it could disappear from there too).  If there are multiple release packages available, please preserve all of them.</p>

<p>Then file an issue against <a href="https://github.com/Conservatory/conservatory.github.io/">this repository</a> with details.</p>

<p>We can take it from there.  However, if you want to save us some time, you can use the <a href="conservatory-import" >conservatory-import</a> script to assemble all the upstream releases into a git repository, and then put that repository somewhere where we can clone it.</p></div>

<div id="why-github" title="why-github" ><h3>Why is the Conservatory on GitHub?</h3>

<p>GitHub offers unlimited zero-cost repository hosting for public source code, is reassuringly large and stable&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;after all, this is an archive, so the whole point is for it to stick around&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and most open source developers know how to work with it (for example, they know how to fork a repository in order to start working on its code).  We encourage people to mirror Conservatory repositories wherever they want; our main criteria in choosing GitHub were stability and familiarity.</p></div>

<div id="who" title="who" ><h3>Who runs the Conservatory?</h3>

<p>The Conservatory was started by <a href="https://github.com/kfogel" >kfogel</a>, partially in response to <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mil-oss/S6YQmkAXyU4/Lngb5OT-o4sJ" >this thread</a>, and he reviews submissions, getting help when needed.  A few other <a href="https://github.com/Conservatory?tab=members" >people</a> have admin access, to help us avoid a low <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor" >bus factor</a>.  We may expand and formalize things depending on the rate of submissions.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 75%;" >Thanks to <a href="http://fdooli.info/" >Felicia Doolin</a> for the logo design.</p></div>
