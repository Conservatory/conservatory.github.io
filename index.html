<p>Welcome to the Conservatory: <a href="https://github.com/Conservatory">github.com/Conservatory</a></p>

<p>The Conservatory is an archive for <a href="http://opensource.org/definition">open source</a> code that doesn't have any other clear canonical version-controlled home on the public Internet.  It's a place to stash code whose authors</p>

<ol>
<li>Haven't put it under public version control, or</li>
<li>Have abandoned it, neglecting even to maintain a public copy, or</li>
<li>Have actively tried to remove it from the Net, its open source license notwithstanding.</li>
</ol><p>(You might think that (3) never happens, but actually it was <a href="https://github.com/Conservatory/openstv">an instance</a> of (3) that motivated the creation of the Conservatory.)</p>

<p>The Conservatory is strictly about preservation and ease of revival.  The presence of a codebase in the Conservatory is <em>not</em> a criticism of the code's authors or former maintainers in any way.  No one is obligated to maintain a version-controlled public repository of anything, unless they've signed a contract to do so, in which case their obligation is to the contractual counterparty not to the public at large.</p>

<p>The Conservatory is archival.  Repositories here do not take pull requests because they are not meant to be the "social master" repository of their respective projects.  If you want to work on one of the codebases here, please fork it to a new repository and work on it there.  If your fork catches on, it will be the new master, and the Conservatory's copy will become less and less important (as well as increasingly out-of-date) -- which is fine.</p>

<h3>
<a name="submitting" class="anchor" href="#submitting"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to submit a codebase.</h3>

<p>First make absolutely sure it's licensed under an open source license, and make sure you've got a copy of the code yourself (don't count on it staying wherever on the Net you found it -- if it disappeared from other places it could disappear from there too).  Then file an issue against <a href="https://github.com/Conservatory/conservatory.github.io/">this repository</a> with details.  That's it :-).</p>

<h3>
<a name="why-github" class="anchor" href="#why-github"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why is the Conservatory on GitHub?</h3>

<p>GitHub offers unlimited zero-cost repository hosting for open source code, is reassuringly large and stable -- after all, this is an archive, so the whole point is for it to stick around -- and most open source developers know how to work with it (for example, they know how to fork a repository in order to start working on its code).  <a href="https://gitorious.org/">Gitorious.org</a> was tempting for philosophical reasons (the code that runs the site is itself open source), and we certainly encourage people to mirror any Conservatory repository there, but our primary goal was stability and familiarity.</p>
