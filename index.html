<div id="main" title="main" ><p>Welcome to the Conservatory:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 7%;" ><a href="https://github.com/Conservatory">github.com/Conservatory</a></p>

<p>The Conservatory is an archive for <a href="http://opensource.org/definition">open source</a> code that doesn't have any other clear canonical version-controlled home on the public Internet.  It's a place to stash code whose authors</p>

<ol>
<li>Haven't put it under public version control, or</li>
<li>Have abandoned it, neglecting even to maintain a public copy, or</li>
<li>Have actively tried to remove it from the Net, open source license notwithstanding.</li>
</ol><p style="font-size: 85%; font-style: italic;" >(You might think that (3) never happens, but actually an <a href="https://github.com/Conservatory/openstv">instance</a> of (3) was part of what motivated the creation of the Conservatory.)</p>

<p>The Conservatory is strictly about preservation and ease of revival.  The presence of a codebase in the Conservatory is <em>not</em> a criticism of the code's authors or former maintainers.  No one is obligated to maintain a public repository of anything, unless they've signed a contract to do so, in which case their obligation is to the contractual counterparty not to the public at large.</p>

<p>The Conservatory is archival.  Repositories here do not take pull requests because they are not meant to be the "social master" repository of their respective projects.  If you want to work on one of the codebases here, please fork it to a new repository and work on it there.  If your fork catches on, it will be the new master, and the Conservatory's copy will become less and less important (as well as increasingly out-of-date) -- which is fine.</p></div>

<div id="submitting" title="submitting" ><h3>How to put code in the Conservatory.</h3>

<p>First make absolutely sure it's licensed under an open source license, and make sure you've got a copy of the code yourself (don't count on it staying wherever on the Net you found it -- if it disappeared from other places it could disappear from there too).  Then file an issue against <a href="https://github.com/Conservatory/conservatory.github.io/">this repository</a> with details.  That's it :-).</p></div>

<div id="why-github" title="why-github" ><h3>Why is the Conservatory on GitHub?</h3>

<p>GitHub offers unlimited zero-cost repository hosting for open source code, is reassuringly large and stable -- after all, this is an archive, so the whole point is for it to stick around -- and most open source developers know how to work with it (for example, they know how to fork a repository in order to start working on its code).  <a href="https://gitorious.org/">Gitorious.org</a> was tempting for philosophical reasons since the code that runs that site is itself open source, and we certainly encourage people to mirror any Conservatory repository there, but our primary goal was stability and familiarity.</p></div>

<div id="who" title="who" ><h3>Who runs the Conservatory?</h3>

<p>The Conservatory was started by <a href="https://github.com/kfogel" >kfogel</a>, partially in response to <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mil-oss/S6YQmkAXyU4/Lngb5OT-o4sJ" >this thread</a>.  A few other people have admin access, to help us avoid a low <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor" >bus factor</a>.  We may expand and formalize things depending on the rate of submissions.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic; font-size: 75%;" >Thanks to <a href="http://fdooli.info/" >Felicia Doolin</a> for the logo design.</p></div>
