__doc__ = """\
Import successive releases into a git repository, presumably for
preservation in https://conservatory.github.io/.

Usage:

  $ conservatory-import [OPTIONS...] PROJ-0.0.tgz [PROJ-0.1.tgz [...]]

Create a git repository named PROJ, and import successive releases
into it.  The arguments are the release tarballs, and they must be
presented as arguments in the right order -- this program does not
try to fix the ordering if you get it wrong.

The releases can be ".tar", ".tar.gz", ".tgz", or ".tar.bz2" format
(support for zip etc is planned, and patches are welcome of course).
Because release package names usually sort lexically, this usage will
typically work:

  $ conservatory-import [OPTIONS...] PROJ-*

Options:

  -r / --readme-prefix PREFIX_FILE

     Prepend the contents of PREFIX_FILE to the "README" file in every
     commit.  The README is identified by trying reasonable variations
     such as "readme.txt", "README.md", "ReadMe.rst", and so on.  See
     https://github.com/Conservatory/dcled/blob/master/README (the
     block at the top of the file) for a good example of prefix text.

  -m / --metadata-dir DIRECTORY

     For every commit, get commit metadata from files under DIRECTORY
     that are named according to the release number.  Use the file
     DIRECTORY/REL-msg as the commit message for release REL, use
     DIRECTORY/REL-date as the git date for the commit, and use
     DIRECTORY/REL-author as the git author.  Each REL must match
     exactly the release identifier portion of the distribution name.
     For example, for "PROJ-1.3.tgz", REL would be "1.3", and for
     PROJ-2.1-beta3.tar.gz" REL would be "2.1-beta3".  If a file is
     not present, then use a default (whatever would have been used
     for that metadata on that commit if -m had not been passed).

  -n / --name-prefixes NAME_PREFIX_1[,NAME_PREFIX2,...]

     Supply a comma-separated list of prefixes to be greedily
     regexp-gobbled before discovering the release identifier.

     This is probably best explained with an example.  Take the
     MHonArc mail archiver package: it was distributed as
     "MHonArc1.2.3.tar.gz", "MHonArc2.0.1.tar.gz", etc, until 2.6.5.
     At that point, upstream started putting a hyphen in the tarball:
     "MHonArc-2.6.5.tar.gz", then "MHonArc-2.6.6.tar.gz", and so on.
     To handle this, you'd pass '--name-prefixes MHonArc,MHonArc-'.

This program does not push the git repository up to the Conservatory
for you.  You have to do that manually, by first creating an empty
repository on GitHub via the web UI, and then pushing all the commits
up to it:

  $ cd new_local_repository_with_all_releases_imported
  $ git remote add origin git@github.com:Conservatory/PROJ.git
  $ git push -u origin master
